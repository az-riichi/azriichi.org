## Rules

We use the current [WRC 2025 Rules](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/634a7884c297a25f06589b79/t/6834d67360e19c1da6c0d12c/1748293243651/WRC+Rules+2025.pdf), with the following modifications.
- Red dora is used, one per suit;
- No kazoe yakuman (i.e. 13+ han is counted as sanbaiman);
- Uma is +30/+10/-10/-30;
- Timer is 60+1 with autotable, and 75+0 without autotable.

## Penalty

[WRC Penalty Rules](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/634a7884c297a25f06589b79/t/6833a1f248230718b731592f/1748214258864/WRC+Penalties+2025.pdf) is frequently used in offline tournaments. For simplicity we consider the following penalties (in increasing seriousness).
- Warning — For minor offenses.
- Dead hand — When the offending player's hand cannot continue normally.
- Chonbo — When opponents’ hands are significantly impacted or the game cannot continue normally. The offending player gets -30P penalty.
- Ban — For repeated and/or very serious offenses. The offending player is not allowed to join competitive tables for the duration of the ban.

Examples:
- Non-penalty: wall is broken (by accident) prior to round start; accidentally reveal 1 tile from the wall during play.
- Warning: knocking over 2-4 tiles from the wall during play; not declaring intentions (chi/pon/kan/riichi); drawing too fast or calling too late; violation of common courtesy.
- Dead hand: wrong calls; hand size too big or too small; revealing 5+ tiles of your own hand.
- Chonbo: knocking over 5+ tiles in from the wall during play; noten riichi (if revealed); invalid ron/tsumo; giving away information about your hand.
- Ban: cheating; verbal or physical abuse; repeated chonbo.

The above examples are not exhaustive and the actual determination is made by a designated referee (if any) or senior members at the table.

## Common Courtesy
- It is important to observe common courtesy during the game. Consider the following examples.
- Keep the conversation to what's necessary to play the game, such as calls and declarations. Banters or discussions on latest anime release can be saved in between rounds or after the hanchan.
- Odd noises, knocking the table or the tiles, and other nuisance should be avoided.
- Use only one hand throughout the game (unless revealing your winning tile).
- After drawing a tile, either put it to the leftmost or rightmost end of your hand or put it on top of your hand sideways. Only insert it after you discard.
- Do not touch the wall for any reason, unless you are drawing from it.
- Always announce your actions (chi/pon/kan/riichi/ron/tsumo).
- Calling too late or drawing too quickly is bad and can lead to penalty.
- There is no timer, however you should try to play in a pace that matches others. Taking excessively long time every turn is unfair to other players.
- Dealer breaks the wall. Dora is flipped by the player closest to it.
  - It is not recommended to separate the dead wall from the regular wall, or move tiles between walls.
- When a player is about to commit a chonbo, you're welcome to point it out to the offending player so they can learn from it.


## Quick References
Below are some quick references to the WRC rules already in place (but you might find them surprising).

**General**
- **No** abortive draw of any kind.
- No more than four kan's can be made.
- OK to riichi even with less than 4 tiles remain in the wall.
- No agari yame.
   - i.e. the game **does not** automatically end if the all-last hand ends with the dealer in 1st place and in tenpai.
- There is liability payment for daisangen, daisuushii and suukantsu.
  - In case of multiple yakuman, only pay for the one you're responsible for.
- No West round.

**Scoring/Yaku**
- Riichi deposits at the end of a hanchan will not be awarded to anyone - it will be recorded as such.
- No double yakuman from a single yaku.
  - e.g. daisuushii is 1x yakuman, but daisuushii + tsuuiisou is 2x yakuman.
- **No** nagashi mangan.
- Koukushi **cannot** be won by robbing a concealed kan.
- Kiriage mangan (4 han 30/3 han 60 rounds up to mangan).
- There is renhou.
  - One declares Ron with their starting hand, without drawing or anyone calling.
  - It is worth 5 han (but does not combine with other yaku or dora). Riichi decl. does not break renhou.
- Double wind pair is worth 2 fu.
