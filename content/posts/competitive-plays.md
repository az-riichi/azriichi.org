As part of AZRM's mission to further mahjong skills and prepare our players for tournaments, we now offer competitive tables at the ASU location every club meet.
Joining competitive table is completely optional, and we have a good number of comp and non-comp tables going on.

At competitive tables, we will enforce stricter competition-style rules (derived from mostly WRC's current rules). The scores of each game will be tracked and the leaderboard will be made public.

From now to the end of 2025, we will trial the proposed rules and collect feedback from our players, and optimize the rules along the way. We expect the system to be fully tweaked and operational at the beginning of 2026 for a new season.

For up-to-date information, please check our dedicated [Competitive Info](/competitive) page. Thank you and we look forward to see you at a comp table!
