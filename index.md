<h1 style="text-align: center;">Arizona Riichi Mahjong</h1>


Arizona Riichi Mahjong (AZRM) is a Japanese riichi mahjong club. We host recurring mahjong gatherings in Tempe and Tucson locations, with more to come.
We welcome mahjong players of all skill levels - from beginners to experts, you will enjoy our friendly atmosphere and supportive learning environment.
For more information, please visit our [About](/about/) page.


## What is riichi mahjong?

Riichi mahjong is an exciting, fast-paced tile game that blends strategy, luck, and skill. Typically played with four people, your goal is to complete a hand by forming sets of three and a pair - think of it as a cross between rummy and poker. The enjoyment comes from making smart decisions, reading opponents, and going "riichi" to bet on that tile you need to win big. With special bonus tiles and scoring combinations, every round is full of surprises.
