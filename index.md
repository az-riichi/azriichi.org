## What is riichi mahjong?

Riichi mahjong is an exciting, fast-paced tile game that blends strategy, luck, and skill. 
Mahjong started in China, it traveled the world and Japan created the variant Riichi mahjong. 
This is the same variant the club plays and is typically played with four people, your goal is to 
complete a hand by forming specific winning conditions (like rummy or poker). This is quickly becoming 
one of the most popular variants around the world.
